                <p class="blog-post-meta">February 19, 2021</p>

                <p>The internet that we know today was nothing like how it was in its early stages. This is not a
                    coincidence since the creation of the internet browser played a key role in the evolution of the
                    modern-day internet and is regularly used to access it today. Upon the invention of the world wide
                    web, it brought upon a war between multiple companies to become the most technologically advanced
                    and most profitable browser.</p>

                <p>Among those companies was <strong>Microsoft</strong>, headed by Bill Gates. He had envisioned that
                    the average person
                    could have personal computers at home with his company’s Windows operating system. The business
                    model at the time was to make profit of customers who would pay to join the Microsoft network in
                    order to access information.</p>

                <p>A war would start as a result of a major breakthrough from a company called <strong>Netscape</strong>
                    with its very
                    first product, Netscape Navigator, a multiplatform browser that a bunch of young computer
                    programmers had designed as a graphical web browser where the user could point and click,
                    making it much more user friendly.</p>

                <p>With the help of rich and well-known entrepreneur and computer scientist, Jim Clark, and the
                    co-author of Mosaic, Marc Andreessen, Netscape was founded in 1994 under the initial name Mosaic
                    Communication Corporation, soon renamed as Netscape Communication Corporation in the same year.
                    It was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the world wide web. When it launched Netscape
                    Navigator, it was an instant success and was the most widely used web browser, causing its
                    competitor, Microsoft, to completely shift their focus on developing a web browser.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>According to Netscape, Microsoft would arrive at their doorsteps to give them a final condition. The
                    deal was probably 1 million dollars for its intellectual property or Microsoft would simply copy
                    their code and crush Netscape. Microsoft denies having made such an offer, but if proven true, it
                    was an illegal act of the antitrust law, which was put in place to prevent giant companies such as
                    Microsoft from becoming a monopoly of the industry. This would be the beginning of an antitrust
                    lawsuit against Microsoft, in which Microsoft was ultimately ruled against as guilty of committing
                    monopolization.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Meanwhile, although Netscape had not made actual profits, its co-founder, Jim Clark, urged the
                        company to go public, and its opening day was a legendary day. It was so successful that the
                        success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term “Netscape moment” to describe an
                        IPO that signaled the dawn of a new industry.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Microsoft kept a tight watch on Netscape’s progress, and a bitter rivalry between the two companies
                    began. Microsoft would make it its mission to destroy Netscape. Microsoft concentrated on developing
                    Internet Explorer, its answer to Netscape Navigator. Ultimately, the difference between Microsoft
                    and Netscape that allowed Microsoft to emerge from the Browser Wars as the final victor was that;
                    Microsoft was a giant company that had already established streams of revenue that Netscape did not
                    have.</p>
                <hr>
                </p>
                <p>While Netscape had to charge its users for the use of its browser, Microsoft was able to offer the
                    browser for free and integrated into their Windows operating system. Upon the release of Internet
                    Explorer 4.0, Microsoft famously threw a party in San Francisco and its employees dumped a large
                    letter “e” logo in the front lawn of Netscape, marking the end of Netscape’s glory days. Netscape
                    was then acquired by America Online, and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer became the most used web
                    browser, replacing Netscape Navigator.</p>
