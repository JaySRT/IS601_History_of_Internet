                <p class="blog-post-meta">February 18, 2021 <a href="#"></a></p>

                <p>The internet is the defining technology of our time and its capabilities make it possible for
                    information to spread across the globe in a matter of seconds and has revolutionized modern
                    communication. It’s worth noting the Internet has not always been around and needed to be developed
                    to what we use today.</p>
                <p>Idea behind the internet was envisioned by a psychologist professor at MIT named JCR Licklider. His
                    vision was that computers would allow people to communicate better which in turn would allow them to
                    aid in the sharing of information among people. The main problem that arose with a network of
                    computers sending information was how such a network would operate. Leonard Kleinrock came up with
                    the idea for packet queueing and distributed routing and switching which led to “hot potato”
                    routing, also known as <strong>Packet switching</strong>.</p>
                <p><img src="images/Packet-Switching-Example.png" alt="Packet Switching"
                        width="750" height="357"></p>

                <p>The only working networks at the time were telephone networks but they had a weakness which arose
                    if the link was broken, the call would be ended, and no information would get to the endpoint after
                    the link had been broken. Packet switching essentially solved the problem since it allowed messages
                    to still be able to reach the endpoint even if certain links were broken.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The idea of creating a network had many possible versions although finding the most effective way was
                    the issue. Larry Roberts, an American engineer who had built the world’s first experimental
                    connection between two computers was recruited for the job. Roberts was not certain how to develop
                    the network since one would essentially have to program computers how to interact with each other
                    which was highly inefficient, this led him to the idea where the use of specialized computers to sit
                    on the network and be the gateways to interface. These gateways were called <strong>Interface
                        message
                        processors or IMPs</strong>.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>IMPs made it possible to expand a network since they would be a universal commonality so to set
                        up a new computer on the network one would just need to have it communicate with their
                        designated
                        IMP instead of other computers. These IMPs became the foundation of the Advanced Research
                        Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). The ARPANET was a tool developed for defense research and was
                        restricted universities and think tanks and involved in defense research. In April 1971, the
                        <strong>ARPANET</strong> had eight-teen mainframe computers connected to the network.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>At first the uses of the ARPANET involved transferring data files among its members, but then a
                    killer application had been developed which expanded its uses dramatically which was email. Computer
                    networks exploded in popularity after the ARPANET demo. <strong>Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide
                        Area
                        Networks (WANs)</strong> started showing up inside companies and campuses.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><img src="images/LANs%20and%20WANs.jpg" alt="LANs and WANs" width="600" height="353">
                </p>
                <p>The rise of these networks led to the problem where the networks would only be private to themselves
                    and had no ability to access any exterior networks. This led to the need for a Standardization of
                    networks that came with TCP IP protocol and gateways allowed for different networks to interface
                    with each other. The main reason networks with gateways work at all was the <strong>TCP/IP
                        protocol</strong>,
                    it was this and shared knowledge which made it possible to convey information to others.</p>

                <p>A major encouragement for the internet explosive growth at the time was the advancement in
                    electronics
                    which brought mainframe computers into the homes and brought computer power down to the size of a
                    desktop PC. Another motivation was on June 4th, 1992 the internet became public instead of
                    government
                    owned and Bernese Lee created the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> which made it easier for your
                    average person to
                    browse the internet.</p>

                <p>In 1992, the world wide web consisted of 50 pages and in 1993 Netscape developed the world’s first
                    breakthrough <strong>browser</strong> which made browsing the internet even easier. The world wide
                    web and the browser
                    have become the foundation of the user-friendly internet that we use today.</p>
