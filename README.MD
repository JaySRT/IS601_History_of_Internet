## History of the Internet 
This website is the part of a Project for credits towards **IS601 - Web Systems Development** This is a really nice course to take. It goes a little hectic for a few weeks of the semester, but that's when we usually learn something new. When we are pushed to cross our limits and meet the deadlines.
