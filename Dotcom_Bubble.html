        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The age of E-Commerce</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">February 18, 2021 by <a href="#">Jay Sorathia</a></p>

        <p>Blah Blah Blah!! Add a good starter line here.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>After reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, <a href="#">Bezos</a> created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, because of the <strong> large worldwide demand for literature, </strong> the low unit price for books, and the huge number of titles available in print. Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington. Bezos' parents invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The AuctionWeb was founded in California on September 3, 1995, by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar as part of a larger personal site. <strong> One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83.</strong> Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer was broken; the buyer explained: "I'm a collector of broken laser pointers. It soon became the first online auction site allowing person-to-person transactions, and its popularity boomed. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Reportedly, eBay was simply a hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service provider informed him he would need to upgrade to a business account due to his high website traffic. The monthly price increase from $30 to $250 prompted him to start <em>charging eBay users </em>, who did not object. Chris Agarpao was eBay's first additional employee to process mailed check payments. </p>

        <p>I am ready for the road less traveled. Already <a href="#">brushing off the dust</a>. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her Karma (come back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Growing fast into a <strong>bolt of lightning</strong>. Be careful Try not to lead her on</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction. She's got that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle.</p>
        <p>This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star.</p>

        <p>From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm walking on air. We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I hope you got a healthy appetite.</li>
          <li>You're never gonna be unsatisfied.</li>
          <li>Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so foreign, it's <em>supernatural</em>, extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.</p>
